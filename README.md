<h1 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

I'm Misaki Michiba, a computer science fresh graduate who has been learning C# and Ruby recently. I love making art and creating stuff. If you're looking for a fresh graduate to fill a full-stack dev opportunity who is willing to learn and soak up skills like a sponge, feel free to contact me!
